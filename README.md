# Exercise

For the first part of the exercise, please update your repos to contain the schema.sql and data.sql files in the correct places! (In the main/java/resources folder) with your database creation (including tables) and data creation (the actual records) in it :) The add, commit and push to github, everyone then does a git pull.

Then start working on the java QLC, remember to have 1 person screen sharing, and you all work on it together :) then after about 15 minutes or so, they will add, commit, and push to github (remember to use feature branches, super important!!!!!) everyone will then do a git pull, and then switch person sharing screen and typing :) Then everyone gets a chance to work on it and everyone gets git practice!! 

Once fully finished, 1 final add, commit and push to git, and then 1 final merge back into the main branch:)
